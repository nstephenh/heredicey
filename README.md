# Heredicey


## About

Heredicey is based on Dicey which is based on the wonderful [AnyDice](https://anydice.com/) made by [Jasper Flick](https://catlikecoding.com/jasper-flick/).

It's UI is completely different from dicey as it is designed to take Warhammer weapon profiles, but it uses dicey's math package.

Dicey is open-source under the MIT license.  It can be found here [github](https://github.com/basicer/dicey).

### I think I found a problem with your math.

Please file a bug report on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/nstephenh/dicey/issues/new).


### Are there any changes to the math package?
Just one, I've added the "++" operator, which adds the probability of non-zero results from two given clouds.
